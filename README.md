# DIY Robo-Advisor Explanation

This project demonstrates the cost difference between using Wealthsimple's robo-advisory service, which charges a 0.5%
management fee, and a DIY approach where you invest in the same assets using Wealthsimple's commission free trading.
By following a
DIY approach, you can save on fees and potentially achieve higher returns over time.
Do note that regardless of the aproach you take you will still pay approximately an additional 0.13% in MER fees
which are charged by the fund providers (Vanguard, BMO, etc.).
